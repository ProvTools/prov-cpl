  1. Required packages on Ubuntu
----------------------------------

Please make sure that the following packages are installed:
  python-dev
  swig


  2. Limitations
------------------

The bindings have been tested only on Linux (more specifically, on Ubuntu) and Mac OS X.


  3. Design
-------------

The Python bindings are implemented as two separate packages:
  1. CPLDirect, which is automatically generated by SWIG from the public
     include files of the C bindings using ../cpl.i as the interface
  2. CPL, a Perl-like API wrapper around CPLDirect
