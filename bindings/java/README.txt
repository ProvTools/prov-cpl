  1. Required packages
----------------------------------

Please make sure that the following packages are installed:
  default-jdk
  swig


  2. Compiling and installing the Java bindings
-------------------------------------------------

To use the bindings by manually including the .jar or to use with Ant:
  cd bindings/java      (if necessary)
  make release
  sudo make install
  finally, move libCPLDirect-java.dylib into your java.library.path or change 
  your java.library.path to include /usr/local/lib

This will (among other things) create /usr/local/java/CPL.jar, which you can
then include in your project. You do not need to include CPLDirect.jar, since
it is statically included in CPL.jar.

Note: If "make release" fails with the "Permission denied" error, please run
"sudo make distclean" first. If "make release" fails mysteriously, perhaps
"sudo updatedb" will help.

  3. Limitations
------------------

The bindings have been tested mainly on OS X.
They have not been thoroughly tested on Linux.


  4. Design
-------------

The Java language bindings are implemented as two separate packages:
  1. CPLDirect, which is automatically generated by SWIG from the public
     include files of the C bindings using ../cpl.i as the interface
  2. CPL, a Java-like API wrapper around CPLDirect


  5. Test
-----------

After compiling and installing:
  cd bindings/java/CPL
  javac test.java -classpath [build/release/CPL.jar] (or whatever
    classpath is appropriate to access CPL.jar)
  java -classpath [build/release/CPL.jar]:. test
